a chatbot (also known as a talkbot, chatterbot, bot, im bot, interactive agent, or artificial conversational entity) is a computer program or an artificial intelligence which conducts a conversation via auditory or textual methods.
such programs are often designed to convincingly simulate how a human would behave as a conversational partner, thereby passing the turing test.
